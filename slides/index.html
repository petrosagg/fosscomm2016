# Running ARM containers on x86 platforms

Petros Angelatos

FOSSCOMM, April 2016

???

We'll talk about what is ARM, why we care, and how we can ARM containers on x86.

We'll start from a simple introduction on emulating ARM, move to more complex examples, then start integrate our approach with Docker and finally improve it.

During each step there will be a live demo.

We'll do an interactive session, so if you have a question please raise your hand.

# About me

* Petros Angelatos


* CTO &amp; Founder of <img src="https://resin.io/logo/logo.svg" width="30px" style="vertical-align: middle" /> **resin.io**
	* Devops for IoT
	* Hundreds of ARM builds per day
	* Many supported CPU architectures

???

We've done a lot of work on making Docker play nice with foreign architectures

---

### ARM

# Most SoC have an ARM core

* Used in almost all mobile phones
* Used in the majority of SBCs


* ARM CPUs
	* Different instruction set
	* Different ABI
	* Different syscall numbers

???

Single Board Computers like RaspberryPi

---

# Why we run ARM on x86

Our goal is to **build Dockerfiles** based on ARM docker images

???

Dockerfiles are recipes for building a docker image

While a Dockerfile for x86 will have a `FROM ubuntu`, for ARM it might have `FROM raspbian`

---

### Why we run ARM on x86

# Alternative: Natively on the target CPU

* Pros
	* Identical build and runtime environment
	* The build has access to hardware peripherals


* Cons
	* Bad performance
	* Maintenance of keeping it online
	* Hardware failures

???

The idea with this method is that a target device will be online and will accept build jobs from a controlling server.

Didn't meet our requirements

---

### Why we run ARM on x86

# Alternative: Natively on ARM servers

* Pros
	* Good performance


* Cons
	* Very few providers
	* Difficult to integrate with other clouds
		* Cross-DC traffic encryption
		* Constraints on where DC can be
		* Data transfer costs

???

Tried but had issues

* Scaleway
	* Was too unstable for production workloads
* Hetzner
	* Added support briefly. Discontinued

---

### Why we run ARM on x86

# Alternative: Emulated hardware on x86

* Pros
	* Independent of infrastructure provider
	* Runs everywhere
	* Pushes multi-DC headaches to the future :)


* Cons
	* Some performance penalty
	* Emulation layer can have bugs

???

* We've been running it in production for 2 years now
* Had to fix bugs in the emulation layer

---

# Emulation layer

* QEMU project (**Q**uick **EMU**lator)
	* Dynamic binary translation
	* Supports many target architectures


* Other options available
	* e.g UMEQ

???

We could use the same technique to run MIPS containers in the future

---

### QEMU

# Introduction

* **system** emulation
	* Like a VM
	* Emulates a **full guest kernel**


* **user-mode** emulation
	* Emulates only the target binary
	* System calls are serviced by **host kernel**
		* Translated by the QEMU runtime

???

We are interested in the user-mode case

---

### QEMU

# Architecture: system emulation

<pre>
+---------------+
| Host process  |
|+-------------+|
||   ARM CPU   ||
|| +---------+ ||            +-------+
|| |   ARM   | ||            | x86   |
|| |  kernel | || <--------> | linux |
|| +---------+ ||            +-------+
|+-------------+|
+---------------+

</pre>

???

The host kernel doesn't see the guest ARM processes, or the filesystem

QEMU must emulate a guest scheduler, a guest filesystem. Slow.

Single core.

---

### QEMU

# Architecture: user mode emulation

<pre>
+---------------+
| Host process  |
|+-------------+|
||   ARM CPU   ||
|| +---------+ ||            +-------+
|| |   ARM   | ||   QEMU     | x86   |
|| | process <---------------> linux |
|| +---------+ || syscall.c  +-------+
|+-------------+|
+---------------+
</pre>

???

Each emulated ARM process maps 1-1 to a host process. While each process is single threaded, multiple process are schedules individually.

Parallel programs run fast enough.

# DEMO

Simple QEMU emulation

???

hello_simple

Compile a simple Go binary for ARM and emulate it

```
go build hello.go
./hello

GOARCH=arm go build hello.go
./hello
file hello
qemu-arm hello
```
---

class: center, middle

# DEMO

Complex QEMU emulation

???

hello_complex

compile a more complex binary for ARM that `execve`s and fails

```
go build hello_parent.go
go build hello_child.go
./hello_parent

GOARCH=arm go build hello_parent.go
GOARCH=arm go build hello_child.go
qemu-arm ./hello_parent # HANGS

strace -f -e trace=process qemu-arm ./hello_parent
```

---

# Processes that spawn processes fail

* `execve(2)` **replaces the image** of a process


* The image of the first process contains QEMU


* The child process doesn't


* x86 kernel **can't run the ARM ELF** format

---

# Processes that spawn processes fail

<pre>
+---------------+            +-------+
| Host process  |   execve() | x86   |
|+-------------+| +----------> linux |
||   ARM CPU   || |          +---|---+
|| +---------+ || |              |      
|| |   ARM   | || |              X ERROR!
|| | process <----+          +---------+
|| +---------+ ||            |  ARM    |          
|+-------------+|            | process |          
+---------------+            +---------+          
</pre>

---

# Inside an `execve(2)`

* Iterate over known binary format handlers
* Use matching handler to run the file


* Binary formats registered through `register_binfmt(struct linux_binfmt *fmt)`


* Built-in binary formats
	* ELF (`fs/binfmt_elf.c`)
	* Shebang (`fs/binfmt_script.c`)

???

The kernel parses the #! from the scripts

---

# binfmt_misc

* Kernel module or built-in (`fs/binfmt_misc.c`)
* **Userspace API** to the binary format subsystem


* Exposed through `binfmt_misc` filesystem
	* Usually mounted on `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc`


* Can register **new binary formats** at runtime
* Used to give native feel to
	* Java applications (through jvm)
	* Windows applications (through wine)

---

# binfmt_misc: ARM emulation

* Specify a magic header to match against
	* ELF header contains the CPU architecture
	* Use the **ARM ELF signature**


* Specify a path to an interpreter
	* Use `/usr/bin/qemu-arm`

```sh
echo ':arm:M::
\x7fELF
\x01\x01\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00
\x28\x00
:\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xfe\xff\xff\xff
:/usr/bin/qemu-arm:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
```

???

# 28' mark

`readelf -h hello`

* `:arm:` -> name of our format
* `M` -> use magic to match binaries
* `\x7fELF` -> ELF magic value
* `\x28` -> e_machine value, architecture
* `:/usr/bin/qemu-arm` -> path to interpreter

Every time a binary matches this magic value, the kernel will run the interpreter instead of the binary and will pass the path of the binary as the first parameter to the interpreter

# binfmt_misc: Integration with Docker

* `binfmt_misc` respects mount namespaces


* Create a hybrid image
	* x86 QEMU binary inside an **ARM rootfs**
	* Use the path configured in `binfmt_misc`

```Dockerfile
FROM resin/armhf-alpine:3.3

COPY qemu-arm /usr/bin/qemu-arm

RUN echo "Hello from ARM Docker container :)"
```

???

I used alpine image because they are super small

Run an ARM Docker container

???

Show `docker info`

```
docker build .
ldd qemu-arm
```

---

# binfmt_misc: Integration with Docker

* Problems with dynamic linking
	* Need to include all the **required libraries**
	* Need to include the **linker**
	* Potentially clashing library paths


* Solution: Link QEMU statically
	* `./configure --static`

```Dockerfile
FROM resin/armhf-alpine:3.3

COPY qemu-arm-static /usr/bin/qemu-arm

RUN echo "Hello from ARM Docker container :)"
```

---

class: center, middle

# DEMO

Run an ARM Docker container with static QEMU

???

docker_static

```
ldd qemu-arm-static
docker build .
```

---

class: center, middle

# NOT GOOD ENOUGH

---

# binfmt_misc is good but not great

* Needs **root access** to configure


* Not present in the majority of hosted tools


* `execve(2)` is to blame


* Can we implement `binfmt_misc` in **userspace**?

---

# Inside an `execve()`, take 2

1. Emulated CPU runs syscall assembly
1. QEMU **traps** the syscall
1. `do_syscall()` from `linux-user/syscall.c` runs
1. Translates syscall number and arguments
1. Calls **host kernel**

---

# Inside an `execve()`, take 2

<pre>
+---------------+
| Host process  |
|+-------------+|
||   ARM CPU   ||
|| +---------+ ||            +-------+
|| |   ARM   | ||   QEMU     | x86   |
|| | process <---------------> linux |
|| +---------+ || syscall.c  +-------+
|+-------------+|
+---------------+
</pre>

???

We can write a hook in syscall.c

---

# Injecting QEMU interpreter

* Change `do_syscall()` in QEMU
* Inject QEMU in the arguments of `execve(2)`

```C
static abi_long qemu_execve(char *filename, char *argv[], char *envp[]) {
    for (argc = 0; argv[argc] != NULL; argc++);

    new_argp = alloca((argc + 3 + 1) * sizeof(void *));

    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
        new_argp[i + 3] = argv[i];
    new_argp[i + 3] = NULL;

    new_argp[0] = strdup("/usr/bin/qemu-arm");
    new_argp[1] = strdup("-0");
    new_argp[2] = argv[0];
    new_argp[3] = filename;

    return get_errno(execve("/usr/bin/qemu-arm", new_argp, envp));
}
```

???

We always execve to qemu. The kernel will never see a raw ARM process

We inject 3 arguments and a NULL at the end so that QEMU knows what do emulate

---

# Dockerfile syntax

* We have to manually start QEMU

```Dockerfile
FROM resin/armhf-alpine:3.3

COPY qemu-arm-static /usr/bin/qemu-arm

RUN [ "qemu-arm", "/bin/echo", "Hello from ARM Docker container :)" ]
```

???

We have to prepend each and every RUN command with "qemu-arm" since there is no kernel module to do this for us.

---

class: center, middle

# DEMO

Run an ARM container without `binfmt_misc`

???

* Disable `binfmt_misc`
	* `echo -1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/arm`

---

# Improving the Dockerfile syntax

* Running a **`RUN`** command

```Dockerfile
RUN foo
```
Becomes
```C
execve("/bin/sh", { "-c", "foo" })
```

* `/bin/sh` is an **ARM binary**

* We could replace `/bin/sh` with something else

---

# Improving the Dockerfile syntax

Use a x86 binary that

1. Restores real `/bin/sh`
1. Injects QEMU and run `/bin/sh` command
1. Puts modified `/bin/sh` back

---

# Improving the Dockerfile syntax

```Go
// sh-shim.go
os.Remove("/bin/sh")
os.Symlink("/bin/sh.real", "/bin/sh")

// Inject QEMU
cmd := exec.Command("/usr/bin/qemu-arm", os.Args...)
cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
cmd.Run()

os.Remove("/bin/sh")
os.Symlink("/bin/sh.shim", "/bin/sh")
```

```Dockerfile
FROM resin/armhf-alpine:3.3

COPY qemu-arm-static /usr/bin/qemu-arm

COPY sh-shim /bin/sh.shim

RUN [ "qemu-arm", "/bin/cp", "/bin/sh", "/bin/sh.real" ]

RUN [ "qemu-arm", "/bin/ln", "-f", "/bin/sh.shim", "/bin/sh" ]

RUN echo "Now I don't have to use square brackets :)"
```
